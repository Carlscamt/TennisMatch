# Tennis Predictor - Glicko-2 Implementation Backup
## Created: July 20, 2025

This backup contains the complete implementation of the Glicko-2 rating system integration and data leakage correction for the tennis prediction model.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project successfully:
1. **Added Glicko-2 rating system** with 3 new features (15.52% combined predictive power)
2. **Discovered and fixed critical data leakage** in the original dataset
3. **Created a production-ready model** with proper temporal validation
4. **Built a web interface** for match predictions and betting recommendations

## üìÅ File Structure

### Core Implementation Files
- `feature_engineering_fixed_no_leakage.py` - Corrected feature engineering without data leakage
- `train_model_no_leakage.py` - Model training with proper time series validation
- `match_predictor.py` - Streamlit web application for predictions
- `test_glicko2.py` - Verification tests for Glicko-2 implementation

### Models (`models/` directory)
- `tennis_model_no_leakage.joblib` - Trained XGBoost model (leak-free)
- `surface_encoder.joblib` - Label encoder for court surfaces

### Data (`data/` directory)
- `tennis_data_features_no_leakage.csv` - Corrected dataset (65,715 matches, 14 features)
- `feature_importance_no_leakage.csv` - Feature importance analysis

### Documentation (`documentation/` directory)
- `DATA_LEAKAGE_ANALYSIS.md` - Comprehensive analysis of the data leakage issue and correction
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Project overview and technical details

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Model Performance
- **Cross-validation Accuracy**: 66.50% (¬±1.59%)
- **Log Loss**: 0.6082 (¬±0.0162)
- **Features**: 9 total features (3 new Glicko-2 features added)

### Feature Importance (Corrected Model)
1. `ranking_diff`: 44.66% - ATP ranking differences
2. `elo_rating_diff`: 25.51% - ELO rating differences  
3. `glicko2_rd_diff`: 10.16% - Glicko-2 rating deviation differences
4. `surface_win_pct_diff`: 6.81% - Surface-specific win percentages
5. `glicko2_rating_diff`: 3.54% - Glicko-2 rating differences
6. `career_win_pct_diff`: 3.19% - Career win percentage differences (corrected)
7. `h2h_win_pct_diff`: 3.04% - Head-to-head win percentages
8. `glicko2_volatility_diff`: 1.82% - Glicko-2 volatility differences
9. `recent_form_diff`: 1.26% - Recent form differences

### Glicko-2 Parameters
- **Initial Rating**: 1500
- **Initial RD**: 350
- **Initial Volatility**: 0.06
- **Tau**: 0.3 (system constant)
- **Rating Period**: Match-based updates

### Data Leakage Correction
- **Original Issue**: `career_win_pct_diff` had 52.79% importance due to future data leakage
- **Solution**: All features now calculated using only pre-match historical data
- **Impact**: More realistic feature importance and production-ready model

## üöÄ How to Use

### Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generate Features (if needed)
```python
python feature_engineering_fixed_no_leakage.py
```

### Train Model (if needed)
```python
python train_model_no_leakage.py
```

### Run Web Application
```bash
streamlit run match_predictor.py
```

### Run Tests
```python
python test_glicko2.py
```

## üîç Key Improvements Made

### 1. Glicko-2 Integration
- Implemented full Glicko-2 rating system with Illinois algorithm
- Added rating uncertainty (RD) and volatility tracking
- Surface-specific rating calculations
- Proper temporal updates with rating periods

### 2. Data Leakage Elimination
- **Problem**: Original dataset used entire career statistics including future matches
- **Solution**: Temporal boundaries ensuring only pre-match data is used
- **Result**: Realistic 66.50% accuracy vs artificially inflated performance

### 3. Model Architecture
- XGBoost with conservative parameters to prevent overfitting
- Time series cross-validation with proper temporal splits
- Balanced training dataset while maintaining temporal integrity

### 4. Web Interface
- Real-time predictions with confidence intervals
- Glicko-2 rating display for both players
- Betting recommendations with uncertainty-based sizing
- Interactive parameter adjustment

## üß™ Validation Results

All Glicko-2 tests passed:
- ‚úÖ Basic rating system functionality
- ‚úÖ Sample data processing
- ‚úÖ Feature difference calculations
- ‚úÖ Temporal boundary compliance

## üìä Data Statistics

### Original (Leaked) Dataset
- 131,430 rows (2 rows per match - artificially duplicated)
- Perfect 50/50 win distribution
- `career_win_pct_diff`: 52.79% importance (suspicious)

### Corrected Dataset
- 65,715 rows (1 row per match)
- Natural win distribution
- `career_win_pct_diff`: 3.19% importance (realistic)
- Proper temporal validation

## üèÜ Production Readiness

This implementation is production-ready with:
- ‚úÖ Proper temporal validation
- ‚úÖ No data leakage
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing
- ‚úÖ Realistic performance expectations
- ‚úÖ Web interface for deployment
- ‚úÖ Betting strategy integration

## üîÑ Version History

- **v1.0** (July 20, 2025): Initial Glicko-2 implementation with data leakage correction
- Features: ELO + Glicko-2 rating systems, leak-free dataset, web interface
