- `backtesting_engine_optimized.py` - Performance analysis framework

### Data Files
- `tennis_data/` - Historical match data (2000-2025)
- `tennis_data.csv` - Processed historical data
- `tennis_model_fixed.joblib` - Trained machine learning model
- `surface_encoder.joblib` - Surface encoding for model

## Technical Architecture

### Machine Learning Pipeline
1. **Data Loading**: Load historical match data from CSV/Excel files
2. **Feature Engineering**: Calculate advanced statistical features for each match
3. **Model Training**: Train XGBoost classifier with time-series cross-validation
4. **Prediction**: Generate win probabilities for new matches
5. **Betting Advice**: Calculate optimal bet sizes using Kelly Criterion

### ELO Rating System
- **Initial Rating**: 1500 for all players
- **K-Factor**: 30-32 for rating updates
- **Temporal Decay**: Ratings decay over time (0.95-0.97 decay factor)
- **Surface-Specific**: Separate ratings for different court surfaces
- **Margin of Victory**: Considers set scores for rating adjustments

### Glicko-2 Rating System
- **Initial Rating**: 1500 for all players (consistent with ELO)
- **Initial RD**: 350 (rating deviation - uncertainty measure)
- **Initial Volatility**: 0.06 (expected rating fluctuation)
- **System Constant (Ï„)**: 0.3 (controls volatility changes)
- **Surface-Specific**: Separate ratings for different court surfaces
- **Uncertainty Handling**: RD increases with inactivity, decreases with match play
- **Volatility Tracking**: Measures consistency of performance over time

### Betting Strategy Features
- **Kelly Criterion**: Optimal bet sizing based on edge and odds
- **Uncertainty Shrinkage**: Reduce bet sizes for uncertain predictions
- **Risk Limits**: Maximum 10% of bankroll per bet
- **Minimum Edge**: Only bet when win probability > 55%
- **Fair Odds Calculation**: Compare model odds with market odds

## Model Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Target >53% for profitable betting
- **Cross-Validation**: Time-series split validation
- **Feature Importance**: Ranking difference typically most important
- **Backtesting**: Tested on out-of-sample 2025 data

## Current Status (July 2025)
- Model trained on data through 2024
- Backtesting completed on 2025 data
- Web interface functional
- Live data scraping operational
- Betting strategy implemented with uncertainty handling

## Usage Workflow
1. **Historical Analysis**: Run backtesting to evaluate strategy performance
2. **Model Training**: Retrain model with latest data as needed
3. **Live Predictions**: Use web app to predict upcoming matches
4. **Betting Decisions**: Follow betting recommendations with proper bankroll management
5. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor actual vs predicted results

## Risk Management
- **Bankroll Limits**: Never bet more than 10% of total bankroll
- **Minimum Edge**: Only bet when model shows significant advantage
- **Uncertainty Handling**: Reduce bets when prediction confidence is low
- **Diversification**: Spread bets across multiple matches when possible

## Future Enhancements
